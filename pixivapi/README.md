# Pixiv API

Yeah, it's a Pixiv API. Mainly based on (pixivpy)[https://github.com/upbit/pixivpy]. It works, for the most part.

### Planned Features
 - Ability to open a browser and authenticate. Maybe that should be more of a frontend thing...
 - Document some of the fields. The restriction ones are probably bools, not sure about the others.
 - Some API calls to get a user return more fields than others. Maybe add those?
