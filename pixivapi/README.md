# Pixiv API

Yeah, it's a Pixiv API. Mainly based on [pixivpy](https://github.com/upbit/pixivpy). It works, for the most part.

### Possible TODOs
 - Document some of the fields. The restriction ones are probably bools, not sure about the others.
 - Some API calls to get a user return more fields than others. Maybe add those?
