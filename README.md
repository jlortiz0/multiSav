# ~~rediSav~~ multiSav, the multiple source image saver

[Grabber](https://github.com/Bionus/imgbrd-grabber) is better than this. I just wanted to save my Reddit saved. And my Twitter saved. And maybe my Pixiv saved.

You know, it would be nice if I combined this and ImageSort, ignoring that they're on different engines. I suppose separating offline and online does make programming things a bit easier. I mean, I could interface everything, but that seems like a poor idea when the semantics of offline and online radically differ.

### To do list
 - Write instructions
 - The various things I put in the comments.
 - Replace ffmpeg.go with an actually decent system
